        <h2>Dear Love,</h2>
        <p1>
            All my life I told myself that I didn't deserve much, that I should settle for what life 
            gives me. I've almost lose hope because you are way out of my leauge but still
            hoping that one day I can finally say that this girl is mine. When I met you I saw the
            perfect one where I might give it a shot though there are some thoughts in my mind saying "I don't stand a chance"
            or  maybe" there is someone who is better than me". After knowing that you are still in contact with miz my 
            heart shattred into pieces though I understand. I can see through your eyes that you're still in pain or whatsoever that time.
            But my love I promise you that I'll always be here through your ups and downs and still continue to pursue you.
            Love is our strongest emotions, and it's something that I crave. My heart screams your name and as you look into my eyes it fix the pain.
            I was miserable until you, where I promised myself not to go all out again but luckily I did because you changed everything
            upside down. I appreciate everything my love. I'm not that very expressive through actions and words but my love I just want you to know 
            that to me you are my everything and I truly love you. My days are not the same without you around. You've becaome an important 
            part of my life. Even though we fight, we will try to fix everything and communicate to each other because there is no relationship
            that is perfect. We fight, argue or even not talking for hours but always remember that my love for you will remain the same and fix every problem we encounter.
            There is something I want to ask you but you don't need to answer it immediately because I'll be patiently waiting for you to be ready.
            Quen Anne, My love let's take our friendship to the next level. Will you be my girlfriend? If you ask me what I like about you? 
            Simple, I like the way you are, the way you changed me to a better version of me, the way you care, your presence and everything about you.
            For you I'll do whatever it takes and give you the love that you deserve. I'll be honest and forever faithful to you. I Love You and I always will.     <br><br>
